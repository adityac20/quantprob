QuantProb : Generalizing Probabilities along with Predictions
==============================

Use duality to build better probability estimates.

Please download the pretrained resnet34/densenet weights trained on CIFAR10 from a source of your choice, and put them in ``models/pretrained`` directory

Then run the following command

```
python src/train_quantile_representations.py
```
